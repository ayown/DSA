          **Summary:** The function `isPalindrome` checks if an integer `x` is a palindrome. It uses no explicit data structures beyond built-in integer variables.  The algorithm reverses the integer `x` digit by digit and then compares the reversed integer with the original. An overflow check is included to prevent errors with large integers.  If the original and reversed integers are equal, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

          - Time Complexity: O(log10(x)). The number of times the while loop runs is proportional to the number of digits in x, which is logarithmic with base 10.
          - Space Complexity: O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
