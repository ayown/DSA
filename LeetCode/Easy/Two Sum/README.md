1. Two SumSolvedEasyTopicsCompaniesHintGiven an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].


Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]


Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]


 
Constraints:


	2 <= nums.length <= 104
	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
	-109 <= target <= 109
	Only one valid answer exists.


 
Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity? Seen this question in a real interview before?1/5YesNoAccepted18,516,580/33MAcceptance Rate56.2%TopicsArrayHash TableCompaniesHint 1A really brute force way would be to search for all possible pairs of numbers but that would be too slow. Again, it's best to try out brute force solutions just for completeness. It is from these brute force solutions that you can come up with optimizations.Hint 2So, if we fix one of the numbers, say x, we have to scan the entire array to find the next number y which is value - x where value is the input parameter. Can we change our array somehow so that this search becomes faster?Hint 3The second train of thought is, without changing the array, can we use additional space somehow? Like maybe a hash map to speed up the search?Similar Questions3SumMedium4SumMediumTwo Sum II - Input Array Is SortedMediumTwo Sum III - Data structure designEasySubarray Sum Equals KMediumTwo Sum IV - Input is a BSTEasyTwo Sum Less Than KEasyMax Number of K-Sum PairsMediumCount Good MealsMediumCount Number of Pairs With Absolute Difference KEasyNumber of Pairs of Strings With Concatenation Equal to TargetMediumFind All K-Distant Indices in an ArrayEasyFirst Letter to Appear TwiceEasyNumber of Excellent PairsHardNumber of Arithmetic TripletsEasyNode With Highest Edge ScoreMediumCheck Distances Between Same LettersEasyFind Subarrays With Equal SumEasyLargest Positive Integer That Exists With Its NegativeEasyNumber of Distinct AveragesEasyCount Pairs Whose Sum is Less than TargetEasyDiscussion (1.5K)Choose a typeComment💡 Discussion Rules1.

I'm new coding and noob in using classes. why no one is writing int main() in their codes. Definetly there will be different versions in the main() i.e taking input from STDIN, passing arguments to class etc. Read more83976AlgoEngineApr 29, 2023Video visualizing how a hash table can reduce the runtime from O(n^2) to O(n):

My original thought is worst case nums = [1,1,1,1] target is 2
then the complexity if N^2... Is it true?
Is there any way to improve this? Read more27751CafogarN4May 24, 2024Not that easy Read more1947AlexTheGreatNov 04, 2014Can't find a better place to ask this...

Many people will come up the same questions that what if there have duplicate numbers in the array?
Well, it's not a problem at all. Because in the description, it says there is exactly one solution. I will prove it here:


Say we have three N1 in the array like this [N1, N2, N1, N3, N1], then N1 will not be part of the result with N2 or N3, since if N1 is part of the result, then we have three solutions which go against the description. N1 cannot be part of result with itself neither since then we have three solutions again. So in this case, we do not care duplicates at all.


So the only possible situation that the N1 can be the result is: N1 MUST only have two of them, and the target MUST be 2 * N1, then we have an array like this: [N1, N2, N1], and a target like this 2 * N1. In this case, after building up the map, N1's index will be the right most one which is 2. Then when we start from the first N1 at index 0, we do (target - N1) and get N1, and then query the N1's index in the array, which is 2, and then we can get the result which is [0, 2] with no problem.
