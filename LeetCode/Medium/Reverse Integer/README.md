7. Reverse IntegerSolvedMediumTopicsCompaniesGiven a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Â 
Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Output: 321


Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321


Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21


Â 
Constraints:


	-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

Js can easily return '9646324351', not zero.Â Read more1037hh548Dec 05, 2014Here is what I got:

I believe an int is not sufficient and the output is exceeding the limit of an 32-bit integer.Â Read more8312Yixian115Jun 07, 2015Number in Python doesn't have limit, either the input or output number won't overflow anyway.
But OJ still requires 0 as outcome of the huge reversed number.Â Read more786NettttSep 29, 20201534236469 < 2^31 should return the reverse, but the solution from test case was 0. Please check.

If we could store longs we wouldn't have to worrry about 32 bit int overflow in the first place.Â Read more49pheonixJul 09, 2019Input:

If overflow has to be simulated, "integer" cell size should be defined as something in the task, e.g. double word.Â Read more1092123459Copyright Â© 2025 LeetCode. All rights reserved.
