2. Add Two NumbersSolvedMediumTopicsCompaniesYou are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sumÂ as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Â 
Example 1:

Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.


Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]


Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]


Â 
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
	0 <= Node.val <= 9
	It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

I'm new coding and noob in using classes. why no one is writing int main() in their codes. Definetly there will be different versions in the main() i.e taking input from STDIN, passing arguments to class etc.Â Read more83976AlgoEngineApr 29, 2023Video visualizing how a hash table can reduce the runtime from O(n^2) to O(n):

My original thought is worst case nums = [1,1,1,1] target is 2
then the complexity if N^2... Is it true?
Is there any way to improve this?Â Read more27751CafogarN4May 24, 2024Not that easyÂ Read more1947AlexTheGreatNov 04, 2014Can't find a better place to ask this...

Many people will come up the same questions that what if there have duplicate numbers in the array?
Well, it's not a problem at all. Because in the description, it says there is exactly one solution. I will prove it here:


Say we have three N1 in the array like this [N1, N2, N1, N3, N1], then N1 will not be part of the result with N2 or N3, since if N1 is part of the result, then we have three solutions which go against the description. N1 cannot be part of result with itself neither since then we have three solutions again. So in this case, we do not care duplicates at all.


So the only possible situation that the N1 can be the result is: N1 MUST only have two of them, and the target MUST be 2 * N1, then we have an array like this: [N1, N2, N1], and a target like this 2 * N1. In this case, after building up the map, N1's index will be the right most one which is 2. Then when we start from the first N1 at index 0, we do (target - N1) and get N1, and then query the N1's index in the array, which is 2, and then we can get the result which is [0, 2] with no problem.
