          **Summary:** The code utilizes singly linked lists to represent two numbers. It iterates through both lists simultaneously, adding corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous addition.  A dummy node simplifies handling the head of the resulting list. The algorithm continues until both lists are processed and there's no carry remaining, creating a new linked list representing the sum.

          - Time Complexity: O(max(m, n)), where m and n are the lengths of the input linked lists l1 and l2 respectively. This is because the while loop iterates a maximum number of times equal to the length of the longer list, plus one iteration for a potential final carry.
          - Space Complexity: O(max(m, n)). The space complexity is determined by the length of the resulting linked list, which is at most one element longer than the longer of the two input lists to accommodate potential carry.
