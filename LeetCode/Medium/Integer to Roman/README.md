12. Integer to RomanSolvedMediumTopicsCompaniesSeven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:

SymbolValueI1V5X10L50C100D500M1000

Roman numerals are formed by appendingÂ the conversions ofÂ decimal place valuesÂ from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:


	If the value does not start with 4 orÂ 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
	If the value starts with 4 or 9 use theÂ subtractive formÂ representingÂ one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example,Â 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IVÂ and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX.Â Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX),Â 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).
	Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5Â (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbolÂ 4 timesÂ use the subtractive form.


Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.

Â 
Example 1:


Input: num = 3749

Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"

Explanation:

3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
 700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
  40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
   9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places



Example 2:


Input: num = 58

Output: "LVIII"

Explanation:

50 = L
 8 = VIII



Example 3:


Input: num = 1994

Output: "MCMXCIV"

Explanation:

1000 = M
 900 = CM
  90 = XC
   4 = IV

Constraints:


	1 <= num <= 3999

But the code does not look good and it's getting bit long. I'm thinking even applying the rules for converting may also make the code complex.

Understand the rules of Roman numeral representation, especially the cases where subtraction is used.
Store the integer values and their corresponding Roman numeral representations.
Try to break down the integer into its place values (ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands) to construct the Roman numeral representation step by step.
