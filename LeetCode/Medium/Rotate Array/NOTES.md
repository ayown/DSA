          Rotate Array

          - Summary: The code uses an integer array `nums`, an Integer array `ar`, and a List `list` to rotate the elements of `nums` by `k` positions.  It first copies `nums` to `ar` to use as an intermediary. It then reverses the entire array, reverses the first `k` elements, and then reverses the remaining elements. Finally, it copies the modified array back into `nums`.

          - Time Complexity: O(n) because the code iterates through the array three times in the reverse operations, each taking linear time.
          - Space Complexity: O(n) due to the creation of a new Integer array `ar` and List `list`, both of which store copies of the input array.
