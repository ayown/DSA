6. Zigzag ConversionSolvedMediumTopicsCompaniesThe string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R


And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);


 
Example 1:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"


Example 2:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I


Example 3:

Input: s = "A", numRows = 1
Output: "A"


 
Constraints:


	1 <= s.length <= 1000
	s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), ',' and '.'.
	1 <= numRows <= 1000

given a string Idonthaveaclue, convert it to wtfareyoutalkingabout, and oh yes do it in a zig zag pattern. good luck.

It will be a good idea  if you provide a detailed test case when there is a 'Run time error'. This will ease the things to debug, especially when the code runs perfectly fine on local machines but not on Leet Code.
