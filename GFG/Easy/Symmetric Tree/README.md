Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is symmetric, i.e., whether the tree is a mirror image of itself.

A binary tree is symmetric if the left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree.

Examples:

Input: root[] = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3]
   
Output: True
Explanation: As the left and right half of the above tree is mirror image, tree is symmetric.

Input: root[] = [1, 2, 2, N, 3, N, 3]
   
Output: False
Explanation:  As the left and right half of the above tree is not the mirror image, tree is not symmetric. 

Constraints:
